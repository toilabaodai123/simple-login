# About  
Use tools and technologies to create an infrastructure for a webservice.
# Tools, other technologies used in this project
- **Docker**  
    - Build a Docker image for the Laravel web application.  
    - Run a Docker container using the image from above on an AWS EC2 instance to serve requests.  

- **AWS**  
    - EC2: For a webservice using a Docker container to handle requests and a Jenkins server  
    - S3: For storing db exported files  
    - RDS: For a database  

- **Jenkins**  
    - To provide CI/CD for the web app  

- **Terraform**  
    - To create an infrastructure which includes 2 aws ec2 instances (1 for web app, 1 for Jenkins)
    - Trigger Ansible to config the infrastructure when the infrastructure is created  

- **Ansible**  
    Config the infrastructure from Terraform, the steps are:  
    ## For **web app** instance:  
    - Install Docker  
    - Add user to Docker's group  
    - Pull Docker image (https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/daipham99/learning) and uses it to run a Docker container  

    ## For **Jenkins** instance:  
    - Install Jenkins  
    - Install Docker  
    - Install AWS Cli
    - Add user to Docker's group   

# The main flow  
- Create the infrastructure using Terraform
- An AWS EC2 instance gets created by Terraform
- Terraform triggers Ansible after creating the infrastructure successfully
- Ansible runs a playbook 
- The AWS EC2 instance is now fully configured by Ansible and ready to serve requests

# For demand for testing
<ins>Please be noticed that since i'm using AWS services at free tier level so i will mostly need to turn it off for finance purporses. 
    The IP of the instances are not static since it will be changed everytime i turn it back on, if you can't connect through the IPs mean the instances are offline or they're online but the IPs have been changed.  
    In case of demands, please feel free to contact on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/kobiet.tuikobiet/).
